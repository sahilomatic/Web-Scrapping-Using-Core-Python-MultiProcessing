						 EF Mount L-Series Lens Aperture Range: f/2.8-22 Two UD and Two Aspherical Elements Ultrasonic Autofocus Motor Manual Focus Override Truly Circular Diaphragm Moisture Proof and Dustproof Sealing Minimum Focus Distance: 7.9"" Rear Gelatin Filter Holder Built-in Lens Hood The  EF 14mm f/2.8L II USM Lens  from  Canon  offers
 a bright maximum aperture and provides an ultra wide-angle view with 
the shortest focal length in the line-up of L-series lenses. Its 
diagonal angle of view is an impressive 114° - anything larger would be a
 fisheye lens. This lens features completely redesigned 
optics, including two high-precision Aspherical elements and two 
UD-glass elements. This results in better contrast and sharpness at the 
outer edges, and a reduction in chromatic aberrations that can sometimes
 be seen with high-resolution digital SLRs. Its minimum focus distance 
is 7.9"" and its truly circular diaphragm helps to create a pleasing 
out-of-focus background. The 14mm f/2.8L II USM lens uses a rear 
focusing system, high-speed CPU, and a ring-type ultrasonic autofocus 
motor (USM) with revised electronics for faster, more responsive and 
quiet AF. Manual focus override allows for precise manual focus even in 
AF mode. This wide aperture lens is the ideal choice for 
architectural, wedding, or other pro-level photography applications and 
its moisture proof and dustproof sealing helps to ensure its durability.

 is an ultra-wide-angle lens with a fast maximum aperture for full frame
 EF mount cameras. A floating rear focusing system gives sharp images at
 all subject distances and an ultrasonic motor (USM) enables fast, 
smooth and quiet autofocus. Full-time manual focus override allows for 
precise manual focus even when in AF mode. The minimum focus distance is
 9.8"".  Sharp, high-contrast images and minimized aberrations 
result from the lens' optical construction which includes aspherical and
 Super UD lens elements. Canon's Super Spectra lens coating suppresses 
ghosting and flare by absorbing light that might otherwise reflect off 
the camera's sensor. A metal front barrel- including filter ring and 
lens hood mount- provides durability and a stable hold for those 
optional accessories.

						 EF Mount L-Series Lens Aperture Range: f/1.4-22 Two Aspherical and Two UD Elements Sub Wavelength Lens Coating Ultra Sonic Motor Autofocus Full-time Manual Focus Override Minimum Focus Distance: 3.0"" Dust and Water Resistant Circular Diaphragm - 8 Blades 77mm Filter Diameter The  EF 24mm f/1.4L II USM Lens  from  Canon 
 lens is a wide-angle prime lens that provides sharp imaging and 
impressive performance at all settings. Its wide maximum aperture of 
f/1.4 allows for effective low-light photography and its circular 
aperture and narrow depth of field provide pleasing background blur. It 
is ideal for photojournalists, landscape and event photographers, and 
anyone who enjoys taking images from a wider perspective. This
 version ""II"" improves greatly over its predecessor with the addition of
 two high-precision aspherical elements, which correct aberration 
including curvature of field and distortion. Chromatic aberration common
 in wide-angle shooting is also reduced by the inclusion of two UD 
lenses, which ensure optimum image quality and corner-to-corner detail. 
The lens elements have anti-reflective SWC (Sub-Wavelength Coating) that
 minimizes ghosting and flaring across the lens surface, regardless of 
the angle with which light enters. The EF 24mm f/1.4L II USM 
lens features Canon's near-silent Ultra Sonic Motor (USM), which 
provides fast auto-focusing with full-time manual override. The floating
 internal focus system also helps maintain image quality throughout the 
focal range. As an L-series lens, it is designed to withstand the 
demands of professional usage and features Canon's advanced weather and 
dust sealing.

Despite the roughly 5x large magnification zoom, the lens size itself is very compact, thanks to use of a compact EMD and a multi-group zoom system, which means this lens works well in fast-moving photographic situations. The optical system uses glass-mold aspherical lenses. Suppressing the curvature of field, spherical aberration, and other distortions common in long focal lengths over the whole zoom range and correcting for other aberrations makes for sharp picture quality. The autofocus is quick and quiet thanks to the ring-type USM and inner focusing system. The full-time manual focus, non-rotating front lens element, and wide zoom ring make the lens a dream to use.

And because the lens comes with an image stabilization mechanism that can compensate for approximately 3 shutter speeds*1, users can take advantage of its full capabilities during handheld shooting at 300mm telephoto and in locations with insufficient lighting. The lens uses environmentally friendly lead-free glass, and with an optimized lens coating and optical design, it minimizes flare and ghosts, which often occur with digital cameras. In addition, it features a zoom ring friction control mechanism, making it possible to freely set zoom operations, and enhanced dust-proof and drip-proof*2 design for shooting under severe conditions.

This lens allows photographers to achieve the reach of a super-telephoto lens, while maintaining superior standards of mobility in the lens through a portable and lightweight form factor. While traditional telephoto lenses are designed with gaps between the optical elements to reduce chromatic aberration, the EF400mm f/4 DO IS II USM uses a gapless dual-layered diffractive optical element, which greatly reduces the ring-shaped diffractive flaring caused by high-intensity light sources. This reduction is taken further with the incorporation of a large diameter ground aspherical lens and a UD lens.  It also contains an improved IS unit that significantly enhances image stabilization when the appropriate IS mode is selected and features a shorter minimum focal distance, down to 3.3m from 3.5m in its predecessor. Maximum magnification has also improved from 0.12x to 0.13x as a result of the superior lens characteristics. The EF400mm f/4 DO IS II USM is highly resistant to harsh environments. This is achieved through a fluorine coating on both the front and rear lens elements, which makes the lens dirt and oil-resistant while easier to clean. All rings and buttons are constructed with a dust and drip-proof structure, preventing dust and liquid from entering the sensitive interior of the lens.
